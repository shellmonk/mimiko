# Mimiko

**Mimiko** is a small domain-specific language for generating and filtering strings using chained constraints (so far).

At the core is the **Oracle** — a conceptual generator of all possible strings. Mimiko lets you narrow this infinite space using regular expressions and other constraints to produce structured outputs.
It can be used to generate synthetic and/or mock data.

> ⚠️ This project is in an early experimental phase. APIs, syntax, and internals are likely to change.
